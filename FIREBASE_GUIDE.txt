# 🔥 Firebase Guide - Understanding Your Database

## What is Firebase?

Firebase is Google's cloud platform that provides a **database** and other services for your app. 

Think of it as:
- 📦 A storage box in the cloud
- 📊 A database that stores student data
- 🌐 Accessible from anywhere on the internet
- 💾 Automatically saves all student progress

## 📁 Database Structure (How Data is Organized):

```
kidtools-e31ab (Your Project)
  └── Firestore Database
      └── users (Collection)
          ├── StudentName1 (Document)
          │   ├── name: "StudentName1"
          │   └── tests: [Array of test results]
          │       ├── Test 1
          │       │   ├── operation: "multiplication"
          │       │   ├── difficulty: "2digit"
          │       │   ├── correct: 8
          │       │   ├── wrong: 2
          │       │   ├── percentage: 80
          │       │   ├── timestamp: "10/10/2025, 3:45 PM"
          │       │   └── wrongAnswers: [Array of mistakes]
          │       ├── Test 2
          │       └── Test 3...
          │
          ├── StudentName2 (Document)
          └── StudentName3 (Document)
```

---

## 🔍 What You'll See in Firestore:

### Collection: "users"
This is like a folder containing all students

### Documents: Individual Students
Each student has their own document (like a file)
- Document ID = Student's name
- Contains their test data

### Fields in Each Document:
- **name**: Student's name (string)
- **tests**: Array of all their test attempts

### Each Test Contains:
- **operation**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division
- **difficulty**: 1digit, 2digit, or 3digit
- **correct**: Number of correct answers (0-10)
- **wrong**: Number of wrong answers (0-10)
- **percentage**: Score percentage (0-100)
- **timestamp**: Date and time of test
- **wrongAnswers**: Array showing which problems they got wrong
  - problem: "5 × 3"
  - userAnswer: 14
  - correctAnswer: 15

## 📊 How to View Student Data:

### Option 1: Firebase Console (Web Interface)

1. **Go to:** https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Open:** kidtools-e31ab project
3. **Click:** Firestore Database (left sidebar)
4. **Click:** "users" collection
5. **Click:** Any student name to see their data
6. **Expand:** "tests" array to see all test attempts

### Option 2: Download Data

In Firestore Console:
1. Click the three dots (⋮) next to a document
2. Select "Export" to download as JSON

---

## 🔐 Firebase Security Rules:

Currently set to **test mode** (open access). This is fine for now, but for production you should secure it.

### Current Rules (Test Mode):
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2025, 11, 10);
    }
  }
}
```

This allows anyone to read/write until the expiration date.

### Recommended Production Rules:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if true;  // Anyone can read
      allow write: if true; // Anyone can write (for student accounts)
    }
  }
}
```

To update rules:
1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Click "Rules" tab at top
3. Edit the rules
4. Click "Publish"

---

## 📈 Monitoring Usage:

### Check Database Activity:
1. Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Click "Usage" tab
3. See:
   - Document reads
   - Document writes
   - Document deletes
   - Storage used

### Free Tier Limits:
- ✅ 50,000 document reads/day
- ✅ 20,000 document writes/day
- ✅ 20,000 document deletes/day
- ✅ 1 GB storage

**Your math game will easily stay within free limits!**

---

## 🛠️ Advanced: Query Data Programmatically

If you want to analyze data outside the game, you can use Firebase Admin SDK or REST API.

### Example: Get All Students
You can write a simple script to:
- Export all student data
- Generate reports
- Analyze performance trends
- Create graphs

Would you like me to create a script for this?

## 🔄 How Data Flows:

1. **Student plays game** → Browser runs your index.html
2. **Answers questions** → JavaScript calculates score
3. **Test completes** → Code calls Firebase API
4. **Data saves** → Firebase stores in cloud
5. **Anyone views leaderboard** → Firebase retrieves data
6. **Data displays** → Shows on all devices instantly
