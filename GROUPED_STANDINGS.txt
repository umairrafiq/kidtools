## 📊 How Standings Are Now Organized:

### **Grouped by:**
- **Operation Type**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Difficulty Level**: 1-Digit, 2-Digit, 3-Digit

### **Separate Leaderboards For:**
- ➕ Addition - 1-Digit
- ➕ Addition - 2-Digit
- ➕ Addition - 3-Digit
- ➖ Subtraction - 1-Digit
- ➖ Subtraction - 2-Digit
- ➖ Subtraction - 3-Digit
- ✖️ Multiplication - 1-Digit
- ✖️ Multiplication - 2-Digit
- ✖️ Multiplication - 3-Digit
- ➗ Division - 1-Digit
- ➗ Division - 2-Digit
- ➗ Division - 3-Digit

## 🏆 What You'll See:

### **Each Test Type Section Shows:**
1. **Title**: e.g., "Multiplication - 2-Digit"
2. **Top 3 Students**: Marked with 🥇 🥈 🥉
3. **All Students**: Ranked by average score in that specific test type
4. **Statistics**: Number of tests taken and average percentage

### **For Each Student:**
- Rank (with medal for top 3)
- Student name
- Teacher name (if viewing all students)
- Number of tests taken for this specific type
- Average score for this specific test type

## 📈 How Averages Are Calculated:

### **Per Test Type:**
If a student takes multiple tests of the same type:
- All scores for that test type are averaged
- Example: John takes 4 "Addition - 1-Digit" tests
  - Test 1: 80%
  - Test 2: 90%
  - Test 3: 85%
  - Test 4: 95%
  - Average: 87.5% (rounds to 88%)

### **Only Relevant Tests Count:**
- Each leaderboard only shows students who took that specific test type
- A student who only did "Addition" won't appear in "Multiplication" standings

---

## 🔍 Visual Design:

Each test type section has:
- **Purple gradient header** with white text
- **White background** for the rankings
- **Color-coded ranking** (#1 🥇, #2 🥈, #3 🥉)
- **Clear spacing** between sections
- **Current user highlighting** (orange background)

## 📱 Teacher View vs. All Students:

### **With Teacher Parameter** (`?teacher=MsCatie`):
```
🏆 Leaderboard - MsCatie's Class

Addition - 1-Digit
  🥇 #1  John   5 tests • 95% average
  🥈 #2  Mike   4 tests • 88% average
```
*(No teacher names shown - all students are from same class)*

### **Without Teacher Parameter** (Global View):
```
🏆 Leaderboard - All Students

Addition - 1-Digit
  🥇 #1  John   5 tests • 95% average • MsCatie
  🥈 #2  Sarah  3 tests • 90% average • MrSmith
  🥉 #3  Mike   4 tests • 88% average • MsCatie
```
*(Teacher names shown for each student)*

## 🎮 How to View:

1. **Log in** to the game
2. **Click "Standings" button** in top menu
3. **Scroll through** different test type sections
4. **Find your ranking** in each category you've attempted

---

## 📊 Sorting:

### **Test Types:**
- Sorted alphabetically by operation then difficulty
- Order: Addition → Division → Multiplication → Subtraction
- Within each: 1-Digit → 2-Digit → 3-Digit

### **Students Within Each Type:**
- Sorted by average percentage (highest first)
- Ties broken by number of tests (more tests = higher rank)
