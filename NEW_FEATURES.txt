## 👩‍🏫 Teacher Support System

### How It Works:

#### For Teachers:
Share custom URL with your students:
```
https://umairrafiq.github.io/kidtools/?teacher=MsCatie
```

Replace "MsCatie" with any teacher name (no spaces, use capitals like: MsSmith, MrJones, DrBrown)

#### For Students:
When a student logs in using a teacher URL:
- ✅ Student is automatically assigned to that teacher
- ✅ Teacher name is saved in Firebase
- ✅ Teacher name displays in student stats

#### Standings/Leaderboard:

**With Teacher Parameter** (`?teacher=MsCatie`):
- Shows only students from that teacher's class
- Title: "🏆 Leaderboard - MsCatie's Class"
- Perfect for classroom competition!

**Without Teacher Parameter** (normal URL):
- Shows ALL students from all classes
- Displays: Student Name • Teacher Name • Score
- Format: "John • MsCatie • 95%"
- Global leaderboard across all teachers!

## 📊 Database Structure Updated

Each user now stores:
```javascript
{
    name: "StudentName",
    teacher: "MsCatie",  // NEW FIELD!
    tests: [...]
}
```
