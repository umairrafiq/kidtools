# ✅ Standings Update - Sorting & Collapsible Sections!

## 🎯 New Features Added:

### 1. **Improved Sorting (Tie-Breaking)**
### 2. **Collapsible Test Type Sections**

## 🏆 Feature 1: Better Sorting with Tie-Breaking

### **How Ranking Works Now:**

#### **Primary Sort: Average Score**
Students are ranked by their average percentage (highest first)

#### **Tie-Breaker: Number of Tests**
When two students have the **same average score**, the student who took **more tests** ranks higher!

### **Why This Matters:**

**Example Scenario:**
- **Sarah**: 100% average (from 5 tests)
- **John**: 100% average (from 2 tests)

**Old Ranking:** Both tied at #1 (random order)
**New Ranking:** 
- 🥇 #1 Sarah - 5 tests • 100% average
- 🥈 #2 John - 2 tests • 100% average

**Reason:** Sarah demonstrated consistency over more attempts!

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Rewards consistency across multiple tests
- ✅ No more random ordering for tied scores
- ✅ Encourages students to take more tests
- ✅ More fair ranking system
- ✅ Students with same score but different experience levels are differentiated

### **Sorting Logic:**
```
1. Sort by average score (highest first)
2. IF scores are equal → Sort by test count (more tests first)
3. Result: Fair, deterministic ranking
```

## 🔧 Technical Details:

### **Sorting Algorithm:**
```javascript
.sort((a, b) => {
    // Primary: Sort by average (descending)
    if (b.average !== a.average) {
        return b.average - a.average;
    }
    // Tie-breaker: Sort by test count (descending)
    return b.testCount - a.testCount;
})
```

### **Toggle Function:**
```javascript
function toggleSection(sectionId) {
    const section = document.getElementById(sectionId);
    const arrow = document.getElementById('arrow_' + sectionId);
    
    if (section.style.display === 'none') {
        section.style.display = 'block';
        arrow.textContent = '▼';
    } else {
        section.style.display = 'none';
        arrow.textContent = '▶';
    }
